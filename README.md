# Big-Mart-Sales

People use Lasso regression model to predict data  that will change in the future to make plans for the future. For many shops and supermarkets it is essential for them to see what can be the most factors that will influence the sales rates. 

In machine learning, a set of data is given and a model is used to predict a result. This paper focused on the process of training the big mart sales data. And predicted the sales on the testing set. 

In data cleaning section, there are some missing data for Item weight and Item visibility in the mart. Missing data imputation methodology has been performed for those sets. Also data correction and data transformation has been implemented.

For outlier determination, we used histogram and qq plot to check the distribution of the outlier and then used the corresponding methodology to detect outliers.

When selecting the variables, this paper used "stepwise" variable selection method and picked up the important variables according to their significant.

In the modeling part, this paper used both generalized linear regression model and Lasso model. And then compare the fitness of model in the testing data set.
